Description: Easy, clean, reliable Python 2/3 compatibility
 ``python-future`` is the missing compatibility layer between Python 2 and
 Python 3. It allows you to use a single, clean Python 3.x-compatible
 codebase to support both Python 2 and Python 3 with minimal overhead.
 .
 It provides ``future`` and ``past`` packages with backports and forward
 ports of features from Python 3 and 2. It also comes with ``futurize`` and
 ``pasteurize``, customized 2to3-based scripts that helps you to convert
 either Py2 or Py3 code easily to support both Python 2 and 3 in a single
 clean Py3-style codebase, module by module.

 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
